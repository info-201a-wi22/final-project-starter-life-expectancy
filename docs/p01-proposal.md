### Abstract
Our main question is how outside factors from the economic situation and health can affect the life expectancy in certain questions, which will be addressed by the social and health data gathered from countries globally. We are concerned with this topic because we have prior knowledge of how more underdeveloped countries had shorter life expectancies due to health crises and wanted to find out what other major factors impact the average life expectancy of a country. Considering that some factors and events target certain countries more than others, it is important to limit this effect by focusing on global factors that affect most countries' populations.

### Introduction
Our project aims at uncovering data of the global life expectancy of humans. Before we dive deeper into understanding life expectancy, in short, life expectancy is the measure of how many years a person is expected to live. In our project we hope to analyze four main factors that could affect life expectancy of a population such as immunization, GDP, substance usage, and education. The data used observes these factors globally with 15 years of recorded data corresponding to each country listed. These four factors are being analyzed because while they are broad, these factors are seen on a global level and mostly affect whole populations. This way, our data can hopefully pinpoint which factors are more prevalent in determining life expectancy and can later become a focus for research with more specific issues within the topic.


### Design Situation
#### _Project framing:_
Our concern is life expectancy varies across our global population but why and what can we do to learn more about the factors using data and evidence. Our key elements when analyzing the topic are the social, cultural and economic factors. The key questions we want to focus on are how different economies, policies, and social factors can affect life expectancy within the country and compared globally.

#### _Human Values:_
The human values connected to our topic of concern consist of awareness in understanding and learning about life expectancy, compassion to help the global populations, and lastly highlight and empathize concerns and research on how to increase life expectancy.

#### _Direct and indirect stakeholders:_
The direct stakeholders are researchers, health care providers, governments, advocates, and the United Nations. These stakeholders hold the value of commitment to learning, researching, and implementing new ideas and change to benefit people worldwide. The indirect stakeholders are those who are most affected from life expectancy, such as the general population.

#### Possible harms and benefits:
##### _Benefits:_
- People will be aware of what effects life expectancy and the reasons, this may result in more funding and resources to countries where life expectancy is low, such as from the findings in _Our World in Data_ wherein the lowest life expectancy of 54 years is from Central African Republic, whereas multiple countries like Canada, Japan, and France exhibit the highest range of life expectancy of 86 years (Roser, Ortiz-Ospina, & Ritchie, 2013).

- Countries with higher life expectancy may be models for countries with lower life expectancy which would result in new developed polices.

- Global life expectancy data and especially visual data ensures we are aware of humans' health over the course of their life span. This world map for example shows life expectancy data as recent of 2019 and the number of years an individual would live specific to each country.

- Visually seeing data can help people learn, interpret, and discuss data (Roser, Ortiz-Ospina, & Ritchie, 2013).

##### _Harms:_
- Stereotyping is a potential harm because countries following behind in life expectancy may have a negative connotation surrounding their peoples, governments, and way of life.

- Life expectancy data may not include all populations. According to the American Journal of Public Health, incarcerated individuals in the United States on average have a lower life expectancy (Patterson, 2013). This example proves a potential harm because there may be missing data on populations such as incarcerated individuals.

- Data may not be the most updated to follow possible natural disasters, global pandemics, and much more. As of recently starting in 2019, Covid-19 began spreading globally across the world with millions of infections and new deaths daily. From the research journal, Direct and Indirect effects on Covid-19 on life expectancy and poverty in Indonesia, the authors discussed how life expectancy is affected by both health and income shocks (Gibson & Olivia, 2020). These shocks to our global population may come abruptly without warning and could lead to a long term effect on life expectancy data.


### Research questions
- _**Is there an association between immunization coverage and life expectancy in the nations surveyed?**_

Countries vary in their ability to provide immunizations due to many factors such as cost, their location, laws, etc. It is important to recognize how a country’s ability or inability to get these resources affect their overall health.

- _**Is the level of schooling worldwide related to life expectancy?**_

Educational levels and opportunities to obtain an education varies between different populations, we want to know how this effects life expectancy worldwide and what educational resources do people need to survive.

- _**Is there a correlation between alcohol usage by nation and life expectancy?**_

Observing alcohol consumption to see the correlation with life expectancy is important because of how common it is and the numerous health concerns that may arise from its abuse. Therefore, the amount of alcohol consumed by different societies and their drinking culture can be a major factor towards life expectancy and should be analyzed.

- _**Is there a correlation between the incomes and economic outputs of countries and their respective life expectancies?**_

The development index of certain nations can be indicative of their health expenditures, access to medical resources, and availability of essential resources. It is important to understand whether these factors play a role in life expectancy to address critical public health issues worldwide.


### The Dataset

Our data table contains **2938** rows and **22** columns. It provides data on **193** different countries with data ranging from 2000-2015. This data represents the multiple countries and their life expectancies and allows us to see the effects of health-related or economic factors for each country throughout those 15 years. The columns range from a variety of topics such as the development status of a country, life expectancy, adult mortality, infant deaths, alcohol consumption, GDP, immunization coverage, population, amount of schooling, etc. Based on these factors, the life expectancy for each country is estimated for each of the years.

The data about life expectancy and health-related data comes from the _Global Health Observatory (GHO)_, a data repository under the _World Health Organization (WHO)_. While the economic data was from the United Nations website. These are two well-known and credible sources for information about countries around the world. The funding for these organizations are usually done through voluntary contributions or assessed contributions. The countries within the data set and its people can benefit from this source as they can see what factors are most detrimental towards their life expectancy and work to fix them.

It was found that in the past, lots of data about life expectancy did not take the effects of immunization and human development index into account. Therefore causing lots of past research to be done by considering linear regression based on a data set of one year for the country. This data set strives to consider these factors over the course of 15 years to get better data on how these factors affect life expectancy and the health of a country. This data set was also created over six years ago, therefore it is not the most recent data set when talking about life expectancies. Especially now while we have factors like COVID-19 also impacting the world’s health.

We obtained this data from [_Kaggle_](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). _Kaggle_ is a database with datasets on thousands of different topics. This dataset in particular is highly valued within the site with almost 700 upvotes and a gold medal attached to it. There are some missing data from less known countries like Vanuatu, Tonga, etc. as well as population sizes. But overall, this data set contains tons of information and has good usability.

### Expected Implications

Factors like healthcare, GDP, education, and substance abuse may play an important role in the average life expectancies of nations worldwide. Since life expectancy is tied to these certain conditions, the implications are clear to policymakers and others that in order to improve quality of life around the world, the root issues facing countries with lagging life expectancies need to be addressed. Countries that have particularly high life expectancies might be models for addressing issues in the United States and in other places as well. Considering many of the nations in the data with the highest life expectancies have different healthcare systems, greater expenditures on schooling, and healthier average lifestyles, it might be important to adopt the policies that work for them. Technologists, designers, and policymakers are all involved in this effort to improve worldwide health, because of their potential ability to improve the systems we have.


### Limitations

Limitations from the data stem from outside factors that could affect life expectancy, such as car accidents, could sway the data. Because of this, the correlations may not be completely accurate, however, by using various categories and data for the major factors that affect whole populations, this limitation is mitigated. Additionally, policies from different countries may heavily affect the data. For example, vaccine mandates and alcohol laws could contribute to the data observed, but it would be too difficult to know and research each countries' policies concerning this and later find out how those policies impact the issue at hand. There is missing data from smaller countries which increases the limitations from the dataset, as well as the fact that the data is gathered from 2000-2015. Because the data is not up-to-date and does not include the pandemic which certainly impacted many deaths worldwide, important factors like economic status and policies and their heightened impact cannot be observed.
