# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[Education Chart](./Education_Chart.R) | Scatterplot visualization between life expectancy and schooling.
|[Vaccination Chart](./Vaccination_Chart.R) | Density chart visualization between HepB vaccinations and infant mortality rates.
|[GDP Chart](./GDP_against_Expectancy.R) | Map visualizations between life expectancy and GDP.
|[Life Expectancy Data](./LifeExpectanctData.csv) | Original data table for life expectancy.
|[Summary Info](./Summary_Info.R) | Calculates values within the data to help answer our questions.
|[Summary Table](./Summary_Table.R) | An aggregated table focusing on values to answer our questions.



# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ... 
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories, which is fine.
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them

# DEVELOPER NOTE 2:  Clear and Concise Documentation
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore, 
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete these NOTE sections and the example CSV file (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
